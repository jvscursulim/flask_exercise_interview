One person may have up to 3 vehicles. The vehicle, registered to a person, may have one color, 'yellow', 'blue' or 'gray'. And one of three models, 'hatch', 'sedan' or convertible. Carford car shop want a system where they can add car owners and cars. Car owners may not have cars yet, they need to be marked as a sale opportunity. Cars cannot exist in the system without owners.
